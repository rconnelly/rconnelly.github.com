                    <p>We try to keep a structured approach to branch management. We love GIT because it provides a straight forward approach to branching and merging. For those that have yet to embrace the power of DVCS <span>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control</span>, I hightly recommend you at least explore it.</p>

<p>Read about DVCS <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control'>here</a>.</p>

<p>Below is a graph that illustrates how we manage our builds. The goal is to keep our production code stable, without slowing our dev cycle down. After some trial and error, we came up with this approach.</p>

<p><img src='/img/blogs/git_branch_mgt.png' alt='Alt Branch Mgt Illustration'/></p>

<h2 id=production_vs_development>Production vs Development</h2>

<p>There are two types of branches: Production and Development (QA). Active development is always done on Development branches. Code can only be merged into production branches from Development (never feature branches). Code can be committed directly to Patch branches, but great care should be taken. Only critical, pre-approved bug fixes should go into a patch branch.</p>

<h3 id=permanent_branches>Permanent Branches</h3>

<p>There are two main, permanent branches that are always available: Master and Development. All continuous integration builds and QA builds come from Development branches Feature and Development.</p>

<h4 id=master_branch>Master Branch</h4>

<p>No active development is ever done on master. Master is always contains a production stable version of the application. Developers always merge from Development to Master</p>

<p><em>Naming Convention:</em> master</p>

<h4 id=development_branch>Development Branch</h4>

<p>The development branch is a some-what-stable version of the software. QA builds from this branch. New features should never be put directly into this branch but instead a Feature branch should first be created to keep the Development branch clean.</p>

<p><em>Naming Convention:</em> development</p>

<h3 id=temporary_branches>Temporary Branches</h3>

<p>Patch and Features branches are typically have short lifespans and are there for the purpose of keeping the master and development branches stable.</p>

<h4 id=patch_branches>Patch Branches</h4>

<p>From time to time, a critical issue will arise in a production build. When this occurs, a temporary Patch Branch is created. Any critical bug fixes can be worked on in this branch. Once a tested stable version is ready, it can be merged back into master. At that point, the code will also be merged back into the development branch.</p>

<p><em>Naming Convention:</em> patch-v{major}.{minor}.{patch} <em>Example:</em> patch-v2.3.1</p>

<h4 id=feature_branches>Feature Branches</h4>

<p>When new features are required, a new branch should always be created. While this branch may only be on a developer&#8217;s local repository, the branch can also be pushed to remote if multiple developers need to work on the same feature.</p>

<p><em>Naming Convention:</em> feature-{description} <em>Example:</em> feature-inventory-tracking</p>

<p>Over the past week, I&#8217;ve been working on a node api for <a href='http://www.shopify.com'>Shopify</a>. It&#8217;s for a side project that we are working on. Apparently, there are no solid node libraries out there for talking with shopify. The only one I found was very limited and didn&#8217;t support all of the api calls. So I decided to write my own module.</p>

<p>The goal is to get it production ready then get it registered with NPM.</p>

<p>Check it out: <a href='http://www.quad.io/shopnode'>http://www.quad.io/shopnode</a></p>

<p>Github: <a href='http://www.github.com/rconnelly/shopnode'>http://www.github.com/rconnelly/shopnode</a></p>

<p>It&#8217;s still in a very rough state, but I&#8217;m releasing it to the public. Before we submit it to be included in NPM, I&#8217;ll need to test it a bit more. I&#8217;m also looking at writing a simple shopify public app which would use this library. Right now, we are only going to use this library for a private app.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been very helpful to develop a node application and I&#8217;ve gained a lot of experience on this little project.</p>

                    <h4 id=founded_by_craftsmen>Founded by Craftsmen</h4>

<p>We founded Quad.io with the goal of building a <strong>software company</strong> focused on creating great software products. Whether we are developing applications for clients or our own customers, we engineer <strong>stable, secure, and testable code</strong>. In a world of mass-produced, careless code, we are proud software craftsmen who put <strong>quality above all else</strong>.</p>

<h4 id=quality_and_value>Quality and Value</h4>

<p>There is an old software adage: <em><strong>Good, Fast, Cheap: Pick Two</strong></em>. We build quality software efficiently. We use the agile methodology to help stay efficient and track metrics of our teams. We focus on good, just-in-time up app design. We build software by concentrating on only the most important features and prioritizing based on actual customer feedback. We help our clients balance the end user needs with their business needs.</p>

<h4 id=rowe__results_only_work_environment>ROWE - Results Only Work Environment</h4>

<p>Our people are what make us great. Without the hard work of engineers, managers, support, and qa, we couldn&#8217;t be successful. Having the right talent is critical to any business. But often attracting and retaining top quality people can be really difficult.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why we are a <strong>Results Only Work Environment (ROWE)</strong>. We are really picky about who we hire, and when we interview candidates must be self-driven, motivated individuals who want to succeed and don&#8217;t need a lot of hand holding. We don&#8217;t have core hours. We don&#8217;t have a requirement to be in the office. Instead, we set very high expectations and judge people not on how much they work or where they work, but <strong>what they accomplish</strong>.</p>

<p>We give employees back their time, and in return, they take the responsibility the company&#8217;s success. <a href='/team'>Find out more about our team</a>.</p>
