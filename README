The quad io web site uses several tools to generate the web site.

It uses Jekyll to build a deploy staticly generated html files from templates.
It uses boilerplate html5 to generate minified html, css, and javascript.
It uses 1140 css grid to create a fluid design.

Running locally:
type: jekyll --server

Then visit:
http://localhost:4000

When making changes int the source code, you'll need to do a commit and push

git add . --all
git commit -m "Changes message"
git push origin master

This will push to the Quad.io-Web and not actually "deploy" the site. That's actually a different repo.


Build and Deploy Instructions:

The website is actually two repositories. One is the source (Quad.io-Web). The other is the deployed website
(rconnelly.github.com).

Because we host on Github pages, we need this separate "deployed" website repo. We have http://www.quad.io pointed to
rconnelly.github.com.

Steps:

cd ./build/
ant build

cd publish
git add . --all
git commit -m "<message here>"
git push origin master

This last step will deploy the code to the server. Github will then make this code available to the public.
